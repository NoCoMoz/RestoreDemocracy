                <p class="text-3xl max-w-6xl mx-auto">Existing accountability measures, such as impeachment and ethics investigations, are designed to address only cases of criminal misconduct, corruption, or clear violations of office rules. These mechanisms, while important, are limited in scope and often require a high threshold of evidence and political will to be enforced. As a result, they fail to provide a solution for situations in which elected officials have lost the confidence of the public but remain in office due to factors such as partisan gridlock, financial backing from powerful donors, or strategic political maneuvering by their party. This creates a significant gap in the democratic process, as there is no direct mechanism for voters to hold legislators accountable in real time outside of scheduled elections. Without a way to remove ineffective, unresponsive, or unpopular officials outside of extreme circumstances, public frustration can grow, leading to increased distrust in government institutions and a sense of disenfranchisement among voters. A more robust system of accountability would help ensure that those in power remain genuinely representative of the people they serve, rather than being shielded by political alliances and institutional barriers.</p>

            <div class="bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-lg">
                <p><strong>Section 1. Recall Power of the People</strong><br>
                The people of each state shall have the power to recall a United States Senator or Representative through a public election, ensuring elected officials remain accountable to their constituents.</p>
        
                <p><strong>Section 2. Recall Petition and Certification</strong><br>
                A recall election shall be held if a petition signed by at least twenty-five percent of the number of voters who participated in the most recent election for that office is submitted and verified by the state's election authority.<br>
                Congress shall have the power to establish uniform verification standards to ensure fair and timely certification of recall petitions, consistent with its authority under Article I, Section 4 of this Constitution. States shall not impose additional requirements that unduly restrict the right to recall.</p>
        
                <p><strong>Section 3. Recall Election Procedures</strong><br>
                A recall election shall be conducted within ninety days of petition certification. A recalled official shall be removed from office immediately upon certification of recall election results.<br>
                If candidates qualify, a successor shall be elected in the same recall election. If no candidate receives a majority, a runoff election shall be held within thirty days. If no candidates qualify for the recall election, the vacancy shall be filled according to the procedures outlined in Section 5.<br>
                A recalled official shall be ineligible to run in the recall election for their own seat and may not run for the same seat in the next regularly scheduled election.<br>
                A recall election shall only be valid if voter turnout meets at least forty percent of the turnout in the most recent election for that office or matches the turnout percentage of that election, whichever is lower.</p>
        
                <p><strong>Section 4. Timing and Frequency of Recall Elections</strong><br>
                No recall election shall be held within the first year of a Senator's term or the first six months of a Representative's term.<br>
                No member shall be subject to more than one recall election per term.</p>
        
                <p><strong>Section 5. Filling Vacancies</strong><br>
                If a Senator is recalled, the vacancy shall be filled in accordance with the laws of the state, consistent with Article I, Section 3, Clause 2 of this Constitution. If state law requires a special election to fill the vacancy, it shall be held within ninety days. If state law permits an appointment, the appointment shall be made in accordance with state procedures, and a special election shall be held if required by state law.<br>
                If a Representative is recalled, the vacancy shall be filled by a special election as required by Article I, Section 2, Clause 4. Congress may, by law, establish a uniform deadline for such elections to ensure timely representation.<br>
                If no candidate qualifies for the recall election, a special election shall be held within sixty days to fill the vacancy.</p>
        
                <p><strong>Section 6. Enforcement and Federal Oversight</strong><br>
                Congress shall have the power to enforce this article through appropriate legislation, consistent with its authority under Article I, Section 4 of this Constitution, to regulate the manner of federal elections.<br>
                If a state fails to hold a recall election within the required timeframe, Congress shall have the power to establish uniform deadlines and procedures to ensure compliance. States that fail to comply shall be subject to legal enforcement as determined by Congress.</p>
        
                <p><strong>NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED</strong>, that the Legislature of the State of [STATE], pursuant to Article V of the United States Constitution, hereby applies to Congress to call a convention for the purpose of proposing the aforementioned amendment; and</p>
        
                <p><strong>BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED</strong>, that this application shall be considered as covering the same subject matter as applications previously adopted by other states for an Article V Convention to propose a congressional recall amendment and shall be aggregated with those applications; and</p>
        
                <p><strong>BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED</strong>, that this application shall remain in effect until at least two-thirds of the states have submitted applications for an Article V Convention limited to this subject, unless it is withdrawn by the Legislature of this State prior to such time; and</p>
        
                <p><strong>BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED</strong>, that copies of this resolution be transmitted to the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, the members of the United States Congress from this State, and the presiding officers of each legislative chamber of the several states, requesting their cooperation in securing the necessary applications from other states to call an Article V Convention for the limited purpose of proposing the amendment described herein.</p>
